## Installation

To build a similar, single page portfolio or website for yourself, you'll want first create a new React app:
```
npx create-react-app <projectname>
```

Then for the single page, smooth scrolling, install react-scroll. To deploy to Github Pages, install gh-pages:
```
npm install react-scroll gh-pages
```
You can also fork and clone this repo to use as a template and then just run npm install

## Usage

You'll be able to run the app locally by running npm start:
```
npm start
```
 Every time you want your deployed site to update with the changes you've made, you need to run npm run deploy

 ```
npm run deploy
```
